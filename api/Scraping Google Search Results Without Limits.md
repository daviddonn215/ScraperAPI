# Scraping Google Search Results Without Limits

When you attempt to fetch results from Google Search directly from your computer, your IP address is likely to get blocked after a certain number of requests. To avoid this issue and scrape Google SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) without limits, specialized tools and services are required. 

One such solution is **Outscraper**, an online scraping service that provides access to public data like Google Search results. Outscraper runs bots on its own servers, utilizing proxies to bypass Google's restrictions, allowing users to extract the same data they see in their browsers efficiently.

## How Outscraper Works

Outscraper helps you bypass Google's restrictions while adhering to its pagination limits. Google only allows up to 40 pages of results for any single query, and Outscraper ensures you can scrape up to this limit. It offers two primary options for scraping Google SERPs:

1. **Google Official Search API**  
2. **Outscraper's Proprietary Scraping Service**

### Google Official Search API

Google's official API provides developers access to various Google services. It serves as a reliable interface for third-party applications to interact with Google's vast array of products. However, this option comes with usage limits and can become expensive for larger-scale scraping tasks.
